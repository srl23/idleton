This project will shape up into a laid back idle city builder production where the player can reign from the early 1900s into what we today would consider the future.

It is intended to be made in the vein of city building and planning games such as the classic DOS SimCity. It's intended to be a peaceful game where the player witnesses the evolution of a city as time goes on. The idea is to create a game where a player can relax and watch progress unfold and at their own pace. 

There may be a toggle option for numerous events the player has to surpass and deal with for those that want it:. It enables events such as (and is not limited to): large fires, floods, general strikes, and even more outlandish ones such as an attack by a giant robot.
